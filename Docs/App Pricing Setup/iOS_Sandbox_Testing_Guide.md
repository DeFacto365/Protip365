print("ðŸ’³ Purchase result: \(result)")
print("ðŸ“± Subscription status: \(currentTier)")
```

### 5.3 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Cannot connect to iTunes Store"**
- Solution: Ensure StoreKit configuration is selected in scheme
- Check internet connection
- Verify bundle ID matches

**Issue: Products not loading**
- Solution: Check product ID matches exactly: `com.protip365.premium.monthly`
- Ensure products are in "Ready to Submit" state
- Wait 24 hours after creating products

**Issue: Trial not showing**
- Solution: Use fresh sandbox account that never purchased
- Clear purchase history in App Store Connect
- Delete and reinstall app

**Issue: Sandbox account won't work**

## Step 6: Transaction Verification

### 6.1 View Transaction History
1. In Xcode: **Debug â†’ StoreKit â†’ Manage Transactions**
2. You'll see all sandbox transactions
3. Can delete transactions to reset state

### 6.2 Check Receipt Validation
Monitor console for receipt validation:
```
âœ… Transaction verified
âœ… Subscription synced to server
âœ… Trial period: true, Days remaining: 7
```

### 6.3 Server Sync Verification
Check Supabase database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_subscriptions
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
AND product_id = 'com.protip365.premium.monthly';
```
